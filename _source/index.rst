Welcome to Aura
===============

Aura is a decoupled, event-driven framework for developing widget-based
applications. As an architecture it takes advantage of patterns best
practices for developing maintainable applications.

The framework itself is constructed and tested with tools many front end
developers find familiar. Aura has source code, a unit test suite and
demos you may view. In addition you may see te latest developments at the
`Aura Github Page`_.

**Features:**

- abstraction of widgets into reusable modules using `AMD`_ format.
- abstraction of vendor library's such as `jQuery`_, `Ender`_ and
  `Zepto`_.
- uses familiar tools inside such as `grunt`_ for develpment
  dependencies and `Bower`_ for browser libraries.
- unit tests in `Mocha`_ and `PhantomJS`_.
- third-party support for `Yeoman`_.

The project is based on concepts discussed by Nicholas Zakas in `Scalable
Application Architecture`_ and by Addy in `Large-scale Application Development`_.
